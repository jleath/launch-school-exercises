# Our problem starts when we attempt to add an employee to the employer using the
# `<<` method. We have aliased this method to refer to the `add` method. The
# EmployeeManagementSystem#add method then calls the `exists?` method, which attempts
# to compare two Employee objects using the `==` method.

# Within the Employee#== method, we attempt to access the private instance variable
# `serial_number` of the Employee object named `other`. Because this variable is
# private, we can't access it. We need to change the access of this variable
# to protected.
